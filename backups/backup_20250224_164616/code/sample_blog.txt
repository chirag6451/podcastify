Alex: Mr. Johnson, I heard that just a week or so ago a little-known Chinese company called DeepSeek quietly debuted an AI app—and then suddenly, U.S. technology stocks dropped billions of dollars. What happened?
Mr. Johnson: That’s right, Alex. Imagine our school, which usually isn’t known for any major breakthroughs, suddenly produced a project that not only matched the work of the top schools but did it on a shoestring budget. DeepSeek is that unexpected project. They developed and trained their AI for just pennies on the dollar compared to the vast sums that American companies spend on research and development.
Alex: So, how is that even possible? And why did it shake things up so much?
Mr. Johnson: Well, DeepSeek’s new model, called DeepSeek-R1, caught everyone’s attention. Experts say it performs just as well as famous models like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. People began to wonder: Is this a technology fluke? A warning shot across the computing bow? Or just an AI anomaly?
Alex: Interesting! So, what exactly is DeepSeek?
Mr. Johnson: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI research lab—think of it like a specialized school for artificial intelligence, similar to OpenAI. It was founded by a hedge fund called High-Flyer. Unlike many other labs that keep their work secret, DeepSeek has a unique approach: it fully open-sources its models, meaning anyone can use them for commercial purposes without restrictions.
Alex: That sounds really different. And what about DeepSeek-R1? How is it special?
Mr. Johnson: DeepSeek-R1 is the latest and most exciting model from DeepSeek. It’s a modified version of their earlier DeepSeek-V3 model, but with a twist—it’s been trained to reason using something called chain-of-thought reasoning. In simple terms, this means the model not only gives you an answer but shows its work step by step, explaining its thinking in natural language. This is similar to how you might solve a math problem on the board, writing down every step so that everyone can see your reasoning.
Alex: That reminds me of when I show my work in class! But what makes DeepSeek-R1 so interesting to experts and investors?
Mr. Johnson: There are two main reasons. First, the fact that a relatively unknown Chinese company managed to build a state-of-the-art model on a much smaller compute budget is seen as a potential threat to U.S. dominance in AI. DeepSeek reportedly spent around $6 million, compared to hundreds of millions that companies like OpenAI invest. Second, because DeepSeek-R1 is fully open source, it can be deployed on your own hardware at a much lower cost than using a closed model like GPT-o1 from OpenAI. This opens up new opportunities for startups and smaller companies to innovate.
Alex: So, even if DeepSeek-R1 isn’t a revolutionary breakthrough in AI itself, its efficiency and open-source nature make it a big deal?
Mr. Johnson: Exactly. While DeepSeek-R1 is more of an incremental advance—mainly showing that previous training methods were a bit inefficient—the real seismic shift here is that it’s fully open source. This means more people can use, modify, and improve upon it. However, it’s important to note that even with these improvements in training efficiency, deploying these models still requires a massive amount of computing power. That’s where the U.S. still holds a significant advantage.
Alex: And what does all this mean for U.S. investors and businesses?
Mr. Johnson: Improvements in efficiency for a technology as general-purpose as AI lift all boats. In our school analogy, imagine if every classroom suddenly had access to top-notch resources—small companies and startups could now compete with the big tech giants. This increased competition is likely to drive innovation, ultimately leading to better products for everyone. However, the big companies still have an edge because they have access to vast platforms and data.
Alex: So, in summary, DeepSeek started as this little-known company that surprised everyone by building a highly efficient, open-source AI model—DeepSeek-R1. It’s been developed on a fraction of the budget of its American counterparts and shows that with good engineering, you can achieve a lot even on a limited compute budget. And its open-source nature might help more players join the game, driving competition and innovation.
Mr. Johnson: That’s a perfect summary, Alex. DeepSeek-R1 may not be a fundamental breakthrough in AI technology, but its efficient training and open-source approach could really shake up the industry, giving smaller companies a chance to innovate and compete. It’s a reminder that sometimes, smart engineering and efficient practices can have a big impact—even if they don’t completely overturn the established order.

 
Alex: Mr. Johnson, I understand that DeepSeek R1 is a really efficient, open-source AI model from China that’s been making waves. But how does it compare with other models like OpenAI’s GPT or Anthropic’s Claude? And can you explain some of the key technical terms in a simple way?
Mr. Johnson: Sure, Alex. Think of our school of AI as a district with many schools. Some schools—like those run by OpenAI or Anthropic—are elite private schools with huge budgets and secret curricula. They invest hundreds of millions of dollars into research. DeepSeek, on the other hand, is more like a community school. It openly shares its teaching materials—its models—so that anyone can use them for commercial purposes. Now, let’s go through some of the key technical terms one by one.
 

Alex: Mr. Johnson, I keep hearing about this amazing thing called DeepSeek R1 in our computer science class. It sounds super complicated. Can you explain what it is using something from school?
Mr. Johnson: Absolutely, Alex! Imagine our school as a huge learning system where every student and teacher plays a part in solving big challenges—just like how DeepSeek R1 works. DeepSeek R1 is a powerful language model, kind of like the star student in our school, built with some very advanced techniques. Let’s break it down using school analogies.
Alex: That sounds cool. Where do we start?
Mr. Johnson: First, think of the parameters in a language model as the settings or knobs on a state-of-the-art mixing board in our school’s media lab. These knobs control every aspect of the music we create, like volume, bass, and treble. In DeepSeek R1, parameters are the tiny settings that get adjusted during training to capture patterns from all the learning materials—or training data—we provide.
Alex: So the parameters are like the dials that help fine-tune the final output, right?
Mr. Johnson: Exactly! The better these knobs are adjusted, the more accurate and balanced the final result is. In our school analogy, the training data are like all the textbooks, lessons, and notes the star student studies. The parameters are tuned to mix this information perfectly so that when DeepSeek R1 needs to answer a question, it produces the right “song” or answer.
Alex: That makes sense. But how does DeepSeek R1 decide which information to use for each question?
Mr. Johnson: Great question! For that, we use a technique called the Mixture of Experts (MoE). Imagine our school has a huge pool of 671 billion tiny tutors—each one with expertise in different subjects. But for any particular test or project, only about 37 billion of those tutors are needed. A smart system, called the Gating Mechanism, works like our school principal who chooses the best-suited teachers for a specific project.
Alex: So, the gating mechanism is like the principal who selects only the right teachers for a particular subject, making the process efficient?
Mr. Johnson: Precisely! It makes the model very efficient by only activating the most relevant “knobs” or parameters for the problem at hand.
Alex: Okay, now how does DeepSeek R1 actually understand a question?
Mr. Johnson: To understand a question, DeepSeek R1 first uses an Embedding Layer. Think of it as a magical translator in our school library that turns a complex essay written in one language into a simple code—a language of numbers that our computers understand.
Alex: So the embedding layer translates the problem into a secret code?
Mr. Johnson: Exactly! Once the problem is translated, it goes through multiple Transformer Layers. Imagine these layers as the different grades in our school building. In each grade, the student learns more details and builds on what was learned in the previous grade. These layers help the model understand the context of the problem step by step.
Alex: I see! Each layer is like a grade that adds more knowledge until the final answer is clear.
Mr. Johnson: Right on. Now, let’s talk about how DeepSeek R1 learns. It goes through two main phases:
1.	Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):
Think of this as our star student studying from a huge textbook filled with examples. In SFT, DeepSeek R1 learns from thousands of examples—simple puzzles with known answers—so it builds a strong foundation. This is like practicing problems over and over until you really understand them.
2.	Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO:
After that, the model practices by playing a game. Imagine our class having a fun contest where everyone tries to solve a puzzle, and the teacher compares the answers. The best answer gets extra points or rewards, like extra credit. In DeepSeek R1, this process is called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Instead of just one teacher grading the work, all the answers are compared, and the best solution gets rewarded. This helps the model learn even better strategies by itself.
Alex: So, the model learns both from studying the textbook and from playing the problem-solving game, which makes it really smart!
Mr. Johnson: Exactly, Alex! And here’s one more fascinating part: chain-of-thought reasoning. When DeepSeek R1 solves a problem, it doesn’t just give you the final answer. It explains every step of its thinking process, just like when you show all your work on a math problem. This way, anyone can see how it arrived at the answer.
Alex: Wow, that’s like not just saying “42” but showing every calculation that got you there!
Mr. Johnson: You got it! And remember, the success of DeepSeek R1 hinges on how well its parameters—the essential knobs—are tuned using high-quality training data. The better the data, the better the tuning, and the more accurately the model can produce answers.
Alex: So, in summary, DeepSeek R1 is like the star student in our school. It uses finely tuned knobs (parameters) adjusted by studying textbooks (training data), gets help from only the best tutors chosen by the principal (Gating Mechanism with MoE), translates problems into a language it can understand (Embedding Layer), and learns gradually through grades (Transformer Layers). It practices by studying from examples (SFT) and playing games where the best solution wins (RL with GRPO), and then it explains every step of its work using chain-of-thought reasoning.
Mr. Johnson: That’s a perfect summary, Alex! DeepSeek R1 is a brilliant combination of advanced technology and smart learning methods, just like our well-organized school. Even the most complex ideas can be broken down into simple, understandable steps when we relate them to everyday school experiences.
Alex: Thanks, Mr. Johnson! Now I understand how DeepSeek R1 works and why it’s so amazing. It really is like a super-smart student who learns by mixing textbook study and fun games, all while explaining every step of the process.
Mr. Johnson: You’re welcome, Alex. Always remember, even the most complicated systems can be understood by breaking them down into simple parts—just like solving a challenging problem at school. Keep exploring and asking questions!
