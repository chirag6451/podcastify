      {
        "order": 1,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "That’s right, Priya. Imagine our school, which isn’t usually famous for major breakthroughs, suddenly producing a project that matches the work of the top schools—but on a shoestring budget. DeepSeek is that unexpected project. They developed and trained their AI for just pennies on the dollar compared to the vast sums American companies spend on research and development."

        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "DeepSeek’s new model, called DeepSeek-R1, caught everyone’s attention. Experts say it performs just as well as famous models like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. People began to wonder: Is this a technology fluke? A warning shot across the computing bow? Or just an AI anomaly?"
      },

        "order": 4,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "Interesting! So, what exactly is DeepSeek?"
      },
      {
        "order": 5,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "DeepSeek is a Chinese AI research lab—think of it as a specialized school for artificial intelligence, similar to OpenAI. It was founded by a hedge fund called High-Flyer. Unlike many labs that keep their work secret, DeepSeek has a unique approach: it fully open-sources its models, meaning anyone can use them for commercial purposes without restrictions."
      },
      {
        "order": 6,
        "speaker": "Priya",

      },
      {
        "order": 7,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "DeepSeek-R1 is the latest and most exciting model from DeepSeek. It’s a modified version of their earlier DeepSeek-V3 model, but with a twist—it’s been trained to reason using chain-of-thought reasoning. In simple terms, the model not only gives you an answer but shows its work step by step, just like when you solve a math problem on the board and write down every step so everyone can see how you got there."

        "order": 8,
        "speaker": "Priya",

      },
      {
        "order": 9,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "There are two main reasons. First, a relatively unknown Chinese company built a state-of-the-art model on a much smaller compute budget—about $6 million compared to the hundreds of millions that companies like OpenAI invest. Second, because DeepSeek-R1 is fully open source, it can be deployed on your own hardware at a much lower cost than a closed model like GPT-o1 from OpenAI. This opens up new opportunities for startups and smaller companies to innovate."
      },
      {
        "order": 10,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So, even if DeepSeek-R1 isn’t a revolutionary breakthrough in AI itself, its efficiency and open-source nature make it a big deal?"
      },
      {
        "order": 11,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Exactly. While DeepSeek-R1 is more of an incremental advance—mainly showing that previous training methods were a bit inefficient—the real seismic shift is that it’s fully open source. More people can use, modify, and improve upon it. However, even with these improvements in training efficiency, deploying these models still requires massive computing power, which is where the U.S. still holds a significant advantage."
      },
      {
        "order": 12,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "And what does all this mean for U.S. investors and businesses?"
      },
      {
        "order": 13,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Improvements in efficiency for a general-purpose technology like AI lift all boats. Imagine if every classroom suddenly had access to top-notch resources—small companies and startups could now compete with the big tech giants. Increased competition is likely to drive innovation and lead to better products for everyone, though the big companies still have an edge because they have vast platforms and data."
      },
      {
        "order": 14,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So, in summary, DeepSeek started as this little-known company that surprised everyone by building a highly efficient, open-source AI model—DeepSeek-R1. It was developed on a fraction of the budget of its American counterparts and shows that smart engineering can achieve a lot even with limited resources. Its open-source nature might help more players join the game, driving competition and innovation."
      },
      {
        "order": 15,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "That’s a perfect summary, Priya. DeepSeek-R1 may not be a fundamental breakthrough in AI, but its efficient training and open-source approach could really shake up the industry, giving smaller companies a chance to innovate and compete. It’s a reminder that sometimes, efficient practices and smart engineering can make a big impact—even if they don’t completely overturn the established order."

        "order": 16,
        "speaker": "Priya",

        "order": 17,

      {
        "order": 18,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "Chirag, I also keep hearing about some key technical terms like training data, parameters, chain-of-thought reasoning, fine-tuning, transformers, and embeddings. Can you explain these in a simple way?"
      },
      {
        "order": 19,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Sure, Priya. Let’s start with **training data**. Think of it as the entire library of textbooks, notes, and assignments our students use at school. It’s a massive collection of texts that the model studies to learn language patterns."
      },
      {
        "order": 20,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So, training data is like all the resources that teach the model how to understand language?"
      },
      {
        "order": 21,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Exactly. Next, **parameters** are like the many dials on a state-of-the-art mixing board in our media lab. These dials get finely adjusted as the model learns from the training data. The better these knobs are tuned, the more accurate the final output. DeepSeek R1 has billions of these dials, which act as its memory."
      },
      {
        "order": 22,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So parameters help fine-tune the final result, just like adjusting the mixer to get the perfect sound?"
      },
      {
        "order": 23,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Exactly. Now, **chain-of-thought reasoning** is like solving a math problem on the board and showing every step of your work instead of just the final answer. It means the model explains its entire thought process step by step."
      },
      {
        "order": 24,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "That makes it much easier to follow, just like when I show all my work in class!"
      },
      {
        "order": 25,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Right. Moving on to **fine-tuning**—this is extra practice after the model learns the basics from the massive textbooks. After studying the training data, the model practices on specialized problems to improve in specific areas. This process is called Supervised Fine-Tuning, or SFT."
      },
      {
        "order": 26,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So, it’s like revising particular subjects after learning the general material?"
      },
      {
        "order": 27,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Precisely. Next, **transformers** are the architecture behind these models. Imagine our school building with many floors—each floor is a Transformer Layer. As you progress through each grade, you build on what you learned before. These layers process and refine the information, helping the model understand context better."
      },
      {
        "order": 28,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So each transformer layer deepens the understanding, like moving up a grade?"
      },
      {
        "order": 29,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Exactly. Finally, **embeddings** are like magical translators. The Embedding Layer converts words into a series of numbers—a secret code that the model can easily work with. It’s like translating a story into a language that only computers understand."
      },
      {
        "order": 30,
        "speaker": "Priya",
        "text": "So, to sum it up: DeepSeek R1 learns from a vast library (training data), fine-tunes billions of knobs (parameters), explains its work step by step (chain-of-thought reasoning), practices with extra problems (fine-tuning), processes information through multiple school floors (transformers), and translates words into secret codes (embeddings)."
      },
      {
        "order": 31,
        "speaker": "Chirag",
        "text": "Exactly, Priya! And while elite schools like those of OpenAI and Anthropic have huge budgets and secret methods, DeepSeek’s open-source approach means its materials are available to everyone. This encourages innovation and gives smaller companies a chance to compete."
